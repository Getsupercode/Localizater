# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

Contributions are accepted via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/getsupercode/localizater).

Also try to code in the same style as Laravel (which followes the [PSR standard](http://www.php-fig.org/) guidelines). StyleCI is set up to fix any discrepancies.

**Happy coding**!
